  'Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a Windows administration feature that provides a uniform environment for local and remote access
  to Windows system components. It relies on the WMI service for local and remote access and the server message block (SMB)
  and Remote Procedure Call Service (RPCS) [2] for remote access. RPCS operates over port 135.An adversary can use WMI to interact with local
  and remote systems and use it as a means to perform many tactic functions, such as gathering information for Discovery 
  and remote Execution of files as part of Lateral Movement. This Specific alert is tailored to the wmiexec.py tool from the impacket framework.'
